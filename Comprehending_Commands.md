# COMPREHENDING COMMANDS

## CAT COMMAND 

We learn about a very crucial command known as "cat" , it is used to concatenate  . To obtain the flag we use the cat command to concatenate the flag file in the home directory . 

## CATTING ABSOLUTE PATHS 

We use the cat command to concatenate the flag file from its absolute path like so : "cat /flag" to obtain the flag which marks the successful compeltion of the challenege 

## CATTING PRACTISE 

XXXXXXX

## GREPPING 

When the files we obtain out of concatenating become too complex we can use the grep command . 
The format for the greo command is as follows : "hacker@dojo:~$ grep SEARCH_STRING /path/to/file"
To obtain the flag the required line of command is as follows : "grep pwn.college /challenge/data.txt"

## LISTING FILES 

We learn about "ls" command which allows us to list the files present in our desktop , We were asked to list files present in a specific directory called "challenge" , on opening that files we will recieve the file location for the "/challenge/run" file 

## TOUCHING FILES 

To create blank files of our own we use the "touch" command .  In this level, we create two files: /tmp/pwn and /tmp/college, and run /challenge/run to get the flag 

## REMOVING FILES 

As important it is to create a file , it is to delete it ,for that "rm" command is used . In this challenge , we create a file called
"delete_me" using touch command which we learned previosuly and then proceed to delete it using "rm" command . Later , run "/challenge/check"
to check whether the file has been successfully deleted or not .
